# comic-rename
Quick utility to rename many digital comic book files.

Essentially being able to point to a folder (Comics) and have it look through all the sub folders and files in those folders. Then deleting everything after (yyyy).  

So from: 
X-Men 001 (2019) Starlight Download.cbz
To:
X-Men 001 (2019).cbz
Note that not all files will have: 
the extension of .cbz
a (yyyy) in the file name (but think most will)
random text after (yyyy)
